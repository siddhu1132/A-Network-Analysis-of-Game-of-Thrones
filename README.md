# A-Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones

## Project Description

In this project, we will delve into the world of Game of Thrones and explore the characters and their interactions throughout the book series. Using a dataset provided by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan, we will construct a character co-occurrence network and analyze its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire.

We will use various centrality measures to determine the most important characters in the network, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank. By analyzing how the importance of characters changes over the course of the book series, we will be able to gain insight into the storyline and character development of Game of Thrones.

This project will provide an opportunity to apply network analysis techniques to a real-world dataset and gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between characters in a popular book series. Whether you are a fan of Game of Thrones or interested in network analysis, this project is sure to be an exciting and informative journey.
