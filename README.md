# A-Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones

## Project Description

In this project, we will delve into the world of Game of Thrones and explore the characters and their interactions throughout the book series. Using a dataset provided by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan, we will construct a character co-occurrence network and analyze its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire.

We will use various centrality measures to determine the most important characters in the network, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank. By analyzing how the importance of characters changes over the course of the book series, we will be able to gain insight into the storyline and character development of Game of Thrones.

This project will provide an opportunity to apply network analysis techniques to a real-world dataset and gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between characters in a popular book series. Whether you are a fan of Game of Thrones or interested in network analysis, this project is sure to be an exciting and informative journey.

# Project Tasks

## **What is the purpose of this project?**

This question is asking for a brief description of loading the dataset required for the project. Specifically, we need to load the dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan, which contains information on the character co-occurrence network in the Game of Thrones book series. The phrase "ASAP" indicates that we should do this quickly or without delay.

## **2. Time for some Network of Thrones**

This question is likely introducing the Network of Thrones blog, which provides additional information on the dataset used in this project. It may be suggesting that we should refer to this blog for more background information or insights on the network of characters in Game of Thrones.

## **3. Populate the network with the DataFrame**

This question is asking for a brief description of how to populate the network with the DataFrame. Specifically, we will need to use the information contained in the DataFrame to add nodes and edges to the network. This process will involve iterating over the rows of the DataFrame and using the information to create nodes and edges using the add_node() and add_edge() functions from the NetworkX library.

## **4. The most important character in Game of Thrones**

This question is asking us to determine the most important character in Game of Thrones using various centrality measures. Specifically, we will use degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank to determine the importance of each character in the network, and then identify the character(s) with the highest centrality scores. The phrase "the most important character" indicates that we are looking for a single character that stands out as particularly important, rather than a group of characters or general trends.

## **5. The evolution of character importance**

This question is asking us to explore how the importance of characters changes over time in the Game of Thrones book series. We will use the same centrality measures as in the previous question (degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank) to analyze the importance of characters in each book, and then compare these scores across the five books in the series. The phrase "evolution of character importance" suggests that we are interested in seeing how character importance changes over time, possibly indicating shifts in the plot or the introduction of new characters.

## **6. What's up with Stannis Baratheon?**

This question is likely asking for an analysis of the character Stannis Baratheon in the Game of Thrones book series. The phrase "What's up with Stannis Baratheon?" suggests that there may be some ambiguity or controversy surrounding this character, and we may want to explore his actions, motivations, or role in the story. Depending on the context, this question may also be asking for a quantitative analysis of Stannis Baratheon's centrality scores or network position, as determined by the previous questions.

## **7. What does Google PageRank tell us about GoT?**

This question is asking us to examine what Google PageRank, a centrality measure used in the previous questions, can tell us about the Game of Thrones book series. The phrase "tell us about GoT" suggests that we are interested in using PageRank to uncover insights or trends in the story or characters. Specifically, we will likely look at the characters with the highest PageRank scores and explore what these characters have in common, what role they play in the story, or how their importance changes over time. This question may also lead us to compare the results of PageRank to those of other centrality measures, such as degree centrality or betweenness centrality.

## **8. Correlation between different measures**

This question is asking us to examine the correlation between different centrality measures used in the Game of Thrones network analysis project. Specifically, we may want to investigate whether there is a correlation between degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank, which are three popular centrality measures used in network analysis. This could involve calculating the correlation coefficients between these measures for each book or for the entire series, and examining the strength and direction of these correlations. This question may lead us to draw conclusions about the similarities and differences between these measures and what they can tell us about the importance of characters in the Game of Thrones series.

## **9. Conclusion**

This question is asking us to draw conclusions based on the results of the Game of Thrones network analysis project. Specifically, we may want to summarize our findings from the previous questions and discuss what they tell us about the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. This could involve highlighting key insights gained from analyzing different centrality measures, identifying trends or patterns in the network, and discussing what these findings reveal about the story, the characters, or the author's writing style. Additionally, we may want to suggest potential future directions for research in this area or discuss the limitations of our analysis.
